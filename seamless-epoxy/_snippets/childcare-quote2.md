A study of childcare prices in
.hl.number[2,360]
U.S. counties across
.hl.number[47]
states shows that childcare prices
for a single child
range from
.hl.number[$4,810]
.hl.qualifier[for school-age home-based care in small counties]
to .hl.number[$15,417]
.hl.qualifier[for infant center-based care in very large counties].
This is equivalent to between
.hl.number[8%] and .hl.number[19.3%]
of median family income per child in paid care.
