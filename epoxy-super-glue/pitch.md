# Pitch for posit::conf()

Hi! I'm Garrick Aden-Buie. I'm a software engineer for Shiny, Posit's open source web framework. But the package I'm excited to share with posit::conf is a personal project called **epoxy.**

Tools like R Markdown, Quarto and Shiny already make data-driven reporting easy. epoxy makes it easier, especially when it comes to the final touches.

Let me show you.

- You might know  R Markdown and Quarto's inline code syntax. Rather than copy-pasting output, we can interleave prose and data, pulling from the source directly.
- But you might want to format the data in a particular way, say adding percents and formatting as currency.
- And here's where epoxy shines. You can use an epoxy chunk to write in markdown using the syntax of the glue package. And you can format values as you use them with epoxy's inline syntax.
- That's the key idea, but there's a lot more to epoxy than can fit in 1 minute. At the full talk, you'd also hear about templating in Shiny apps, re-usable templates, and tips on approaches for data-driven reporting in general.
